# Control Variates for Stochastic Gradient MCMC

Companion code to the preprint [Baker, Fearnhead, Fox, Nemeth (2017) Control Variates for Stochastic Gradient MCMC](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05439). This code implements each of the Experiments. For the comparison section available in version 1, please see the repo [BigDataMCMCComparisons](https://github.com/jbaker92/BigDataMCMCComparisons).

If you want an easy way to implement SGMCMC algorithms (including control variate algorithms), consider using the `R` package [`sgmcmc`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sgmcmc/index.html) which has a lot of easy to implement packages. Companion paper for the package available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.00578).

For details of how to run the code, please see other READMEs.
